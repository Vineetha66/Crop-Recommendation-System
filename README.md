# Crop Recommendation System
This repository implements a crop recommendation system using ML models. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and Streamlit deployment for an interactive UI.

## #Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a Crop Recommendation System designed to assist farmers in making informed decisions on which crops to plant based on various environmental factors. The system leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze data inputs such as soil type, rainfall, temperature, and other relevant parameters, providing recommendations that optimize yield and resource utilization.

## #Features
- **#Data_Input:** Users can input parameters like soil type, rainfall, temperature, and more.
- **#Machine_Learning_Model:** The system uses a trained machine learning model to predict the most suitable crops for the given conditions.
- **#User-Friendly_Interface:** A frontend interface allows users to easily interact with the system and receive crop recommendations.

## #Technologies_Used
- **Backend:** Python, Flask/Django (optional for web application)
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Machine_Learning:** scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
- **Deployment:** Streamlit or Flask for web-based interaction
